Welcome to the <Philippines>!
How are you?
I'm doing well, thank you.

This <rice> is delicious.
Yes, it is delicious.

This is Ann. Here is her husband, Steve.
Ann is Steve's wife.

There is one car.
How much does the car cost?
He is driving the car. She is driving the car.
Is that the man's car or the woman's car?

There is only one beautiful car.
That is not Steve's car. That is not the man's car. That is the woman's car.
No, there are two cars.
He has a car and she has a car.

I have a car. You have a car.
It was nice meeting you. Goodbye!
